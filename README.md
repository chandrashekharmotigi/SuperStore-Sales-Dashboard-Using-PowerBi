# SuperStore Sales Dashboard: A Data-Driven Approach to Boost Sales Performance

## Project Overview :
In this project, I leveraged two years of sales data from SuperStore, a fictional retail company 🛒, to craft an immersive and interactive dashboard 📈. This tool unveils crucial insights and trends about sales performance across diverse categories, segments, regions, and payment modes. Predictive analytics was also applied to forecast future sales based on historical data. <br>

## Skills Demonstrated :
- 🔗 Data Extraction
- 🧹 Data Cleaning
- 🔄 Data Transformation
- 📊 Data Visualization
- 🔮 Sales Forecasting <br>

## Key Findings :
- 📦 The top three sales categories are Phones, Chairs, and Binders, indicating a high demand for these products in the market.
- 🚚 The most preferred ship mode is Standard Class, followed by Second Class, First Class, and Same Day, suggesting that customers are willing to wait for their orders if they can save on shipping costs.
- 📈 The sales performance varies across different sub-categories within Office Supplies, Technology, and Furniture, implying that some products are more popular than others in each category.
- 🎯 The largest sales segment is Consumer, followed by Corporate and Home Office, reflecting the customer base and the purchasing power of each segment.
- 💵 The most common payment mode is Cash on Delivery (COD), followed by online transactions and card payments, indicating that customers prefer to pay upon receiving their orders rather than in advance.
- 🌎 The West region is the best performing region, followed by East, Central, and South, revealing the regional differences in sales potential and customer preferences.
- 🗓️ The highest sales months are September, November, and December, suggesting a seasonal pattern and a possible influence of holidays and festivals on sales behaviour.
- 💰 The most profitable months are March, October, and December, highlighting the importance of optimizing the sales strategy and the product mix during these periods.

## Project Learnings :
- 🎛️ **Complex parameters** for filtering and slicing data by different criteria, such as product category, region, date, and customer segment.
- 📈 **Customized calculations** for deriving new metrics and insights, such as sales growth, profit margin, and customer retention rate.
- 📊 **Diverse visualizations** for displaying data in various formats, such as bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter charts, line charts, map and slicers.
